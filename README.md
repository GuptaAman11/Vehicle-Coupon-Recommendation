# Vehicle-Coupon-Recommendation
The In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation dataset was created to study whether a person will accept a coupon offered while driving under different scenarios. The dataset includes 12,684 instances with 25 features, such as destination, time, weather, passenger details, and more. The primary task is classificationâ€”predicting whether a person will accept the coupon based on these features. The data were collected through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, simulating various driving conditions and offering coupons for different services like restaurants or coffee houses.

Key features include:

Destination: Where the driver is heading (e.g., home, work).
Passenger: Who is in the car (e.g., alone, with friends).
Weather: The current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy).
Coupon type: The type of coupon offered (e.g., restaurant, coffee house).
Expiration: How soon the coupon expires (e.g., 1 day, 2 hours).
Outcome (Y): The target variable indicating whether the coupon was accepted (1 for yes, 0 for no).
The goal is to analyze and model the behavior of drivers in accepting or rejecting coupons based on these factors. This information could be useful for businesses aiming to optimize their in-vehicle marketing strategies.
